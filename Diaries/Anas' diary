in the past week:
 - i started to familiarze myself with unity and how it works
 - started learning and familiarizing myself with C#
 - going over certain designs for the rocks and the wall and how to implement them in unity

Feb 25:
 - downloaded Blender, a software used to create shapes and animations,
   the projects or files in this software can be transported and used in unity
 - started working on learning how the software works
 - for my part, i am currently handling the creation of the character in the game,
   and using this software will help creating a humanoid object with limbs and joints
   that can be animated and moved, after the creation of the character, the humanoid object
   will then be transported as one object to unity. those 3D assests are going to be
   implemented later alonside the movement script and functions worked on in unity.

Mar 6:
 - created the character for the first version of the game on blender.
