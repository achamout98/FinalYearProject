  Completed some research pertaining to our project. 
  Found an article/tutorial on how to implement a rock climbing game in UnityVR
  Set up unity for VR.
  Wrote user story and user experience including, game start, game functionality and end.

  Worked along side adam to complete the core features of the game including:
    - Basic climbing mechanics
    - Jumping which was later removed
  We adjusted the physics components of the game as well:
    - There was an issue with the colliders which was fixed. The character was not grabbing the rocks porperly, we had to adust
    the colliders by making them slightly larger than their bodies.
  Finally, I smoothed up the climbing process so the character does not look like he is just teleporting to the rock's location but
  actually making his way up there
