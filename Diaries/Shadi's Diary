  This week I sat down with my group members and worked on refining the concept and scope of our rock climbing game. 
  We defined the basic gameplay mechanics that should be applicable whether or not we are working with VR (will be described
  in a separate document). I found a very useful tutorial about implementing rock climbing mechanics for VR in Unity, and will 
  attach the link below. I also downloaded Unity and I am ready to start learning how to code in it once we know what hardware we have
  available at our disposal.

  This week my teammates and I realized we are very behind on schedule and need to pick up the pace. Adam and Ali have picked up the
  role of game design and scripting in Unity while Anas has taken the role of model design using Blender. I have decided to try to
  to learn the two as best as I can in order to help coordinate between the two "teams" so to speak.

  This week I experimented with bump mapping to give our mountain a texture to make it look like an actual mountain. First attempt was 
  not satisfactory but now I have the basics down and I can continue experimenting. If we are to look into other methods of texturing
  I will await Dr. Turkiyyah's advice to do so.
